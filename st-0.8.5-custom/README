## Readme

This is a custom patched version of st (simple terminal) by me. 

We included the following patches (alphabetical order):
* alpha
* anysize
* boxdraw
* clipboard
* defaultfontsize
* delkey
* dracula
* scrollback (with mouse)
* w3m hack

There were some manual resolution necessary between alpha/boxdraw/scrollback, so use this patched version for convenience. 

For further changes, the font is changed to DejaVu Sans Mono size=16. No other changes were made.

st version is 0.8.5.
