# Unix-like system dotfiles, customization, and more

Dot files and more for my personal use. 
If you somehow came across this repo and want to copy anything, feel free.

### Contents (not in any particular order)

* Gentoo kernel configs (5.17.5) for Dell 7390 2-in-1 (note: the setting is pretty minimal!)
* bspwm & sxhtk configs
* sway config
* polybar config
* bashrc (make sure to rename to .bashrc)
* xinitrc (make sure to rename to .xinitrc)
* st-0.8.5 source code (patched and customized)
* i3status-rust config
* Some wallpapers I collected

Enjoy!
