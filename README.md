# Unix-like system dotfiles, customization, and more
### Last updated: 6/13/2022

Dot files and more for my personal use. 
If you came across this repo and want to copy anything, feel free to do so. 

The repo is licensed as "unlicensed", so you can literally do whatever you want with these files.

### Actively maintained

* Gentoo kernel configs
* waybar config
* riverwm config
* bspwm/sxhkd config
* polybar config
* bashrc (make sure to rename to .bashrc)

Enjoy!
